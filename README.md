Ever heard of the Pomodoro study technique? It’s a time-management method where you study for 25-minute sessions, followed by 5-10 minute breaks. But what happens when you're in the middle of a productive "flow state"? Suddenly, your study timer interrupts with a scheduled break, breaking your concentration and momentum. 

That's where **Flopodoro** comes in.

## What is Flopodoro?

Flopodoro is a study timer designed to keep you in the zone. It includes both the traditional **Pomodoro** technique and the more flexible **Flomodoro** approach. Here’s how the Flomodoro method works:

1. Start the Flomodoro timer.
2. Work until you feel the need for a break.
3. Press the stop button when you're ready for a break.
4. Flopodoro will calculate the optimal break time based on the duration of your work session.

No more unnecessary interruptions—Flomodoro lets you stay in your flow state for as long as possible.
